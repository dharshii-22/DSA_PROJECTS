The game starts with a 3x3 empty board.
Players take turns to place their symbol ('X' for human, 'O' for computer) on an empty cell.
The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is full (draw).
# 🚀 How to Play
Run the TicTacToe.cpp file in a C++ compiler.
Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a cell numbered from 1 to 9 to place your symbol ('X').
Enjoy playing the game and try to beat the computer!
